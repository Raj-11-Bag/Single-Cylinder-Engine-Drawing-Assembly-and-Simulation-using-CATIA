## Installation

### Prerequisites
- CAD software compatible with .CATProduct files (e.g., CATIA V5 R21).
- Simulation software (CATIA V5 R21).

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Raj-11-Bag/Single-Cylinder-Engine-Drawing-Assembly-and-Simulation-using-CATIA.git
    ```
2. Open the `.CATProduct` file in your CAD software.

## Usage

### Design
The design phase includes creating each component of the engine assembly. Each part was modelled with precision to ensure proper fit and function.

### Modelling
The modelling phase involved defining the geometry and material properties of each component. Key elements include:
- **Piston**: Modelled for accurate motion simulation.
- **Crankshaft**: Detailed for dynamic analysis.
- **Cylinder Block**: Designed to house the moving parts.

### Simulation
Simulation was conducted to analyze the performance of the engine assembly. Key simulations include:
- **Dynamic Simulation**: To study the motion of the pistons and crankshaft.
- **Stress Analysis**: To evaluate the durability of components under load.

### Example
To run a simulation, follow these steps:
1. Open the assembly in your CAD software.
2. Navigate to the simulation module.
3. Set up the necessary parameters (e.g., boundary conditions, loads).
4. Run the simulation and observe the results.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Please follow these steps to contribute:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/YourFeature`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/YourFeature`).
5. Open a pull request.
